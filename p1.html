The programmers use coded language to write instructions that a software can understand to do what the programmer (or computer user) wants. The most basic computer-oriented language (called low-level) is that the machine language that uses binary ('1' and '0') code that a computer can run (execute) very quickly without using any translator or interpreter program but is tedious and complicated. High-level languages (such as Basic, C, Java) are much simpler to use (more 'English-like'), but they need to use another program (a compiler or interpreter) to convert the high-level code into the machine code, and are thus slower. There is a low level programming language for each CPU hardware platform that generates one for one machine language. High-level languages (what most programmers write in) use compilers that generate many machine instructions for every ASCII text file statement the programmer writes (see compiler). There also are programming languages that are translated into machine language one statement at a time whenever they run (see interpreter)
